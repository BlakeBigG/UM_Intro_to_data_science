One way of visualizing this is through the use of a histogram. A histogram is a univariate (meaning \"single variable\") plot that displays the range of values of a variable on the x-axis (horizontal axis). On the graph, there are bins that extend upward on the graph and represent the count of values that exist within that bin's value range. Take the histogram of the `df$Age` below. The blue section represents a single bin between the values of 52 and 54 years of age. There are ten rows of data that fall in the bin, which you can visualize by going up the bin and looking at the value on the y-axis. \n",

It isn't hard to tell that 153 is an outlier in this sample, but since the mean takes all of the points into consideration, it will be highly influenced by it. The mean of this sample would be 35.16666 with a standard deviation of 57.739 years! \n",

The median is the middle positioned value in an ordered set of numbers. Following our example above, we would first order our numbers from least to greatest (or vise versa), 10, 11, 11, 13, 13, 153 and then select the number in the middle position. Since this list of numbers is even and there is no middle value, we would take the two most central values and find their mean. These two values would be 11 and 13, whose mean is 12. So the median is 12. \n",

    "The first argument of the `hist()` function is the numerical object `df$Age`. In fact, this is the only argument that you need when calling `hist`. The `breaks` argument just adjusts the number of bins. Each bin has an equal range of values. For example, we passed 20 breaks as an argument. Given that our age range is from 0 to about 100, 20 breaks would be about a bin size of 5. So the first bin is from 0 to about 5, the second from 5 to about 10, and so on.\n",

This is done by finding the inter-quartile range (IQR), or the 1st quartile (25%) subtracted from the 3rd quartile (75%). In this case the IQR is 47 - 20, or 27. The bars on this plot are known as the inner fences and they are found by taking the value of 3rd quartile + (1.5 X IQR)  and 1st quartile - (1.5 X IQR). In our case we get 87.5 and -20.5. Anything beyond these bounds are suspected outliers, which is why we see any point above 87.5 as dots. Since it is impossible to have a negative age, there are no suspected outliers beyond the lower inner fence."
